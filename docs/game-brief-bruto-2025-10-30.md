## Appendices

### A. Research Summary

- Primary references already compiled:
  - `docs/GDD.md` — full GDD outlining pillars, mechanics, epics, and scope.
  - `docs/habilidades-catalogo.md` — catalog and grid analysis for all combat skills.
  - `docs/stast.md` — authoritative stat, weapon, and pet data lifted from the original.
  - `docs/brainstorming-session-results-2025-10-30.md` — structured ideation capturing goals, scope, and implementation notes.
- Vision mandate: rebuild the original El Bruto experience first; refinements come after the faithful recreation is complete.
- Combat promise: matches must stay fast, RNG-driven, and surprising every time—mirroring the original cadence.

### B. Stakeholder Input
