# El Bruto - Game Design Document

**Author:** vice
**Game Type:** Auto-battler / Idle Fighter with RPG Progression
**Target Platform(s):** Web (Browser-based)

---

## Executive Summary

### Core Concept

A web-based auto-battler where players create and manage up to 4 "brutos" (fighters) that battle automatically against other players' brutos. Each bruto progresses through infinite levels, gaining random stat increases, weapons, skills, and pets. Combat is probabilistic with critical hits, dodging, and special abilities creating unique battles every time.

### Target Audience

Casual to core web gamers who enjoy idle/auto-battler games with progression systems, ages 13+, prefer short to medium play sessions (limited to 6 fights per day).

### Unique Selling Points (USPs)

1. **Faithful Recreation** - Authentic recreation of original "El Bruto" mechanics
2. **Local Matchmaking Innovation** - Fight against other users' brutos stored in local database (offline ghost system)
3. **Battle Replay System** - Review your last 8 fights to analyze strategies
4. **Emergent Complexity** - Simple systems + RNG = infinite unique battles
5. **Infinite Progression** - No level cap, endless character growth

---

## Goals and Context

### Project Goals

1. Faithfully recreate the core mechanics of the original "El Bruto" game
2. Implement complete progression system with infinite leveling
3. Create engaging auto-battle combat with randomization
4. Deliver fully offline local-first web experience

### Background and Rationale

This is a personal recreation of "El Bruto" focusing on maintaining the original's simplicity while adding two technical improvements: local database matchmaking against other users' brutos, and a replay system for the last 8 battles. The project embraces "emergent complexity" where simple systems combined with RNG create unique, unpredictable gameplay.

## Game Mechanics

### Primary Mechanics

**Combat Stats System:**
- **HP (Health Points)** - Starting: 60, increases by +12 per full stat boost or +6 per split
- **STR (Strength)** - Starting: 2, determines damage dealt (STR value = damage amount)
- **Speed** - Starting: 2, determines probability of extra attacks/turns
- **Agility** - Starting: 2, determines dodge chance percentage

**Character Management:**
- **Create Bruto** - Name + random appearance (10 designs Ã— color variations)
- **Multi-Character System** - Manage 3 brutos (default), expandable to 4 with coins
- **Delete Bruto** - Option to remove unwanted characters

**Progression Mechanics:**
- **XP Gain** - Lose: +1 XP, Win: +2 XP
- **Level Up Choice** - Select from 2 random options each level
- **Infinite Leveling** - No level cap

**Equipment & Abilities:**
- **Weapons** - 4 categories (Fast, Heavy, Sharp, Long), each with unique stats
- **Skills** - ~40+ abilities copied from original game
- **Pets** - 4 types (Dog, Wolf, Panther, Bear) with fixed stats

**Economy:**
- **Coins** - Earn 100 coins at level 10
- **Bruto Slot Purchase** - 500 coins = +1 slot (max 4 total)

**Matchmaking & Replays:**
- **Same-Level Matching** - Only fight brutos at your exact level
- **Opponent Pool** - Choose from 5 random opponents
- **Replay System** - Store and review last 8 battles

## Combat System (Auto-Battler)

### Combat Algorithm

**Combat Type:** Turn-Based Auto-Battle
**Execution:** Fully automated with visual feedback

**Combat Actions Per Turn:**
1. **Base Attack** - Always executes (damage = STR value)
2. **Weapon Attack** - Chance to trigger based on weapon stats
3. **Skill Activation** - Chance to use equipped skills
4. **Critical Hit** - Chance for double damage (base + weapon/skill modifiers)

**Defensive Mechanics:**
- **Dodge** - Agility stat determines % chance to avoid attacks
- **Speed Advantage** - Extra turn probability based on Speed stat

**Combat Flow:**
1. Determine turn order
2. Attacker executes actions (base + weapon chance + skill chance)
3. Defender checks dodge (Agility %)
4. Calculate damage (with critical chance)
5. Apply damage to HP
6. Check win/loss condition
7. Repeat until HP reaches 0

### Weapons System

**4 Weapon Categories:**

| Category | Characteristics |
|----------|----------------|
| **Fast** | Higher attack speed, lower damage, increased crit chance |
| **Heavy** | Slower attacks, massive damage, lower accuracy |
| **Sharp** | Balanced stats, high critical damage multiplier |
| **Long** | Extended reach bonus, medium damage |

**Weapon Attributes:**
- **Reach** - Attack range modifier
- **Odds** - Probability to trigger weapon attack
- **Hit** - Accuracy rating
- **Speed** - Attack speed modifier
- **Damage** - Base damage value
- **Crit Chance** - Critical hit probability

### Skills System

**~40+ Skills** (from original game)

**Skill Categories:**
- **Offensive** - Damage boost, multi-hit attacks
- **Defensive** - Dodge increase, damage reduction
- **Buffs** - Temporary stat increases, crit chance up
- **Status Effects** - Varies by specific skill

**Skill Activation:** Probability-based during combat turns

### Pets System

**3 Pet Types** (Dog can be obtained multiple times)

| Pet | HP | Damage | AGI | SPD | Combo% | Evasion% | Initiative |
|-----|----|----|-----|-----|--------|----------|------------|
| **Dog** (A/B/C) | 14 | Low | 5 | 3 | 10% | 0% | -10 |
| **Panther** | 26 | Medium | 16 | 24 | 60% | 20% | -60 |
| **Bear** | 110 | High | 2 | 1 | -20% | 0% | -360 |

**Pet Mechanics:**
- **Fixed stats** - Do not level up or evolve
- **Stacking** - Can have up to 3 Dogs (A, B, C) simultaneously
- **Combinations** - 3 Dogs + Panther OR 3 Dogs + Bear (not Panther + Bear together)
- **Resistance Cost** - Acquiring pets reduces bruto's Resistance stat:
  - Dog: -2 Resistance (base), -3 with Vitality, -7 with Immortality
  - Panther: -6 Resistance (base), -9 with Vitality, -15 with Immortality
  - Bear: -8 Resistance (base), -12 with Vitality, -28 with Immortality
- **Combat Role** - Attack independently alongside bruto during battles

## Progression and Balance

### Player Progression

**Infinite Leveling System:**
- No level cap - endless progression
- XP per fight: Win = +2 XP, Loss = +1 XP
- Daily limit: 6 fights per 24-hour period (8 with Regeneration skill)

**Level-Up Progression:**
1. Gain required XP (increases per level)
2. Choose from 2 random options (A or B):
   - **New Skill** (~40+ skills from pool)
   - **New Weapon** (from 25+ weapons across 4 categories)
   - **Full Stat Boost:**
     - +2 STR OR +2 Speed OR +2 Agility OR +12 HP (2 Resistance)
     - With augmenter skills: +3 instead of +2 (STR/Speed/Agility), +18 HP instead of +12
   - **Split Stat Boost:**
     - +1/+1 to two stats OR +6 HP + 1 other stat
     - With augmenter: +1.5/+1.5 or +9 HP + 1 stat
   - **Pet** (Dog/Panther/Bear)

**Starting Stats:**
- HP: 60 (50 standard + 10 from base Resistance)
- STR: 2
- Speed: 2
- Agility: 2
- Resistance: ~1.67 (gives 10 HP)

**Augmenter Skills** (Permanent +50% boost to stat gains):
- **Herculean Strength** - +50% STR gains (+3 per level instead of +2)
- **Feline Agility** - +50% Agility gains (+3 instead of +2)
- **Lightning Strike** - +50% Speed gains (+3 instead of +2)
- **Vitality** - +50% HP/Resistance gains (+18 HP instead of +12)
- **Immortality** (rarest, 0.01% odds) - +250% Resistance, -25% other stats

**Progression Milestones:**
- **Level 10:** First coin reward (100 coins)
- **Every 10 levels:** Potential additional rewards
- **Infinite:** Continuous stat/skill/weapon accumulation

### Difficulty Curve

**Matchmaking Difficulty:**
- **Strict Level Matching** - Only fight opponents at exact same level
- **Build Variety** - Each opponent has unique stat/skill/weapon distribution
- **RNG Creates Challenge** - Randomness in opponent builds, critical hits, dodges

**Pacing by Level Range:**
- **Early (1-10)** - Learn mechanics, build foundation, acquire first weapons/skills
- **Mid (11-50)** - Expand arsenal, refine build strategy, discover synergies
- **Late (51-100)** - Optimize build, master complex combinations
- **Endgame (100+)** - Perfect min-maxing, rare skill combos, infinite scaling

**Challenge Sources:**
- Opponent stat distribution (high STR vs high Agility builds)
- Weapon/skill synergies (armor-piercing vs evasion builds)
- Pet combinations (3 Dogs swarm vs single Bear tank)
- Critical hit variance (can turn fights instantly)
- Dodge/block RNG (high-risk high-reward moments)

**Balance Mechanisms:**
- Daily fight limit prevents grinding advantage
- Guaranteed progress (always gain XP, even on loss)
- Random upgrades prevent perfect min-maxing
- Level-locked matchmaking ensures fair fights

### Economy and Resources

**Currency System:**
- **Coins** - Only currency in game
  - Earned at level milestones (100 coins at level 10)
  - Single use case: bruto slot expansion

**Coin Usage:**
- **Bruto Slot Expansion** - 500 coins = +1 slot (max 4 total)
  - Default: 3 bruto slots
  - Maximum: 4 bruto slots (requires 500 coin purchase)

**No Traditional Economy:**
- No shop for weapons/skills/pets (all earned via leveling RNG)
- No premium/paid currency
- No consumables or temporary items
- No trading or marketplace
- All progression through level-up choices only

---

## Level Design Framework

### Level Types

**Note:** "El Bruto" does not use traditional level/stage design. Combat takes place in a single arena environment.

**Arena Type:**
- **Combat Arena** - Single fighting environment where all battles occur
- Visual: Simple arena background (faithful to original)
- No environmental hazards or stage gimmicks
- Focus purely on character-vs-character combat

### Level Progression

**N/A** - Game uses character-level progression (1 â†’ âˆž) rather than stage/level progression.

All progression tied to:
1. **Bruto leveling** (infinite levels)
2. **Opponent selection** (5 random same-level opponents per fight)
3. **Daily fight availability** (6 per day limit)
