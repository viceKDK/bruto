# Story 2.2: Bruto Slot Management

Status: done

## Story

As a player,
I want to view my available bruto slots, unlock additional slots with coins, and delete unwanted brutos,
so that roster management matches El Bruto.

## Requirements Context Summary

### Requirement Sources
- `docs/epics.md` — Epic 2 Story 2.2 defines slot management requirements and acceptance criteria (default 3 slots, 4th slot for 500 coins, delete confirmation).
- `docs/GDD.md` — Section 15 specifies economy with slot purchases and Section 10 details character management mechanics.
- `docs/architecture.md` — Section 11 maps Epic 3 (Character Management) to architecture components.

### Key Requirements
- Display bruto slot UI showing 3 default slots with 4th slot locked.
- Implement slot unlock mechanism requiring 500 coins payment.
- Add bruto deletion with confirmation dialog to prevent accidental removal.
- Remove all related data when bruto is deleted (stats, weapons, skills, pets, battle history).
- Persist slot unlock state in database per user account.
- Prevent exceeding 4 total bruto slots.

## Structure Alignment Summary

### Learnings from Previous Story

**From Story 2-1-account-creation-and-login-flow (Status: drafted)**

- **Authentication Complete**: User registration and login functional
- **Session Management**: Zustand useUserState storing current user
- **AuthService Available**: Password hashing and verification working
- **Navigation Wired**: Login → BrutoSelectionScene flow established
- **Error Handling**: GameError integration with validation complete

[Source: stories/2-1-account-creation-and-login-flow.md#Dev-Agent-Record]

- Slot management will be implemented in BrutoSelectionScene which users reach after login.
- Use UserRepository to track slot unlock state and coin balance.
- BrutoRepository will handle delete cascades to related tables.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Default state: three slots; fourth slot locked behind 500 coins.
2. Slot unlock updates DB and UI instantly; cannot exceed four slots.
3. Deleting a bruto confirms action and removes related data (stats, history).

  - [x] Subtask 2.2 Implement purchase flow: check balance, deduct coins, update slots, refresh UI
  - [x] Subtask 2.3 Add validation preventing unlock if insufficient coins or already unlocked

- [x] Task 3 (AC: 3) Implement bruto deletion
  - [x] Subtask 3.1 Add delete button to each bruto slot

  - [x] Subtask 3.3 Wire cascading delete through BrutoRepository removing bruto, weapons, skills, pets, battles
  - [x] Subtask 3.4 Refresh slot UI after deletion

## Story Body

### Implementation Outline
1. Extend users table schema with bruto_slots (default 3) and coins (default 0) columns.
2. Create slot UI layout in BrutoSelectionScene displaying 3-4 slots based on unlock state.
3. Build coin balance display component in UIScene or scene header.
4. Implement slot unlock button with 500 coin check and purchase transaction.
5. Create confirmation modal component for bruto deletion.
6. Extend BrutoRepository with delete cascade logic using foreign key constraints.
7. Wire all slot operations through Zustand state updates for instant UI refresh.
8. Add unit tests for slot unlock validation and deletion cascade logic.

## Dev Notes

### Learnings from Previous Story

- **User Session Active**: Current user data available in Zustand state
- **Scene Navigation**: BrutoSelectionScene is entry point after login
- **Repository Pattern**: Use UserRepository for coin/slot updates, BrutoRepository for deletions
- **UI Components**: Modal and button components ready for confirmation dialogs

Leverage database foreign key constraints (ON DELETE CASCADE) to automatically remove related records when bruto is deleted.

### Project Structure Notes

**Slot Management Components**:
```

  scenes/
    BrutoSelectionScene.ts    # Main slot management UI
  database/
    repositories/
      BrutoRepository.ts      # Cascade delete logic
      UserRepository.ts       # Coin and slot tracking
  components/
    ConfirmModal.ts           # Reusable confirmation dialog
```

### Agent Model Used

### Debug Log References

- 2025-10-30 19:00 Implementation Plan:
  1. Load latest user + bruto data via repositories and render slot panels in `BrutoSelectionScene`, including coin header (AC1).
  2. Wire unlock workflow for slot four (500-coin cost) with validation, persistence, and UI refresh (AC2).
  3. Add delete confirmation modal that cascades removal through `BrutoRepository` and re-renders slots (AC3).
  4. Sync Zustand store after mutations and surface feedback messaging for insufficient coins or missing user state.
- 2025-10-30 19:32 Build Verification: `npm run lint` (tsc --noEmit) passed after slot management + deletion implementation.

### Completion Notes List

- **BrutoSelectionScene**: Replaced placeholder with full slot dashboard showing three active slots plus locked fourth slot, coin/slot header, and details/delete buttons.
- **Unlock Flow**: Added 500-coin unlock logic that updates `users` row via `UserRepository`, refreshes state, and blocks unlock when balance insufficient or slot already unlocked.
- **Deletion Safety**: Wired confirmation modal per slot, calling `BrutoRepository.delete()` to rely on DB cascades for weapons/skills/pets/battle history cleanup.
- **State Sync**: Refreshes Zustand session after mutations so UIScene coin display and downstream scenes stay consistent; keeps navigation to BrutoDetailsScene intact.
- **Validation**: `npm run lint` (TypeScript check) passes, confirming compile-time safety.

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** vice  
**Date:** 2025-10-30  
**Outcome:** Approve

**Summary**
- Slot dashboard, unlock workflow, and deletion flow align with Epic 2 expectations; no blocking issues found.
- Story context file not available; review proceeded with story + architecture references only.
- Epic 2 tech spec not present; architecture.md served as primary standard.

**Key Findings**
- Low: No story context file found for 2-2; consider generating one via `story-context` for richer background.
- Low: No Epic 2 tech spec document located under docs/; ensure planning artifacts are generated for future stories.
- None: No functional regressions or acceptance-criterion gaps detected.

**Test Coverage and Gaps**
- Note: No automated tests were added for slot unlock or deletion flows; consider unit tests around repository updates when test harness is available.

**Architectural Alignment**
- Implementation keeps slot management in the scene layer while delegating persistence to repositories, consistent with docs/architecture.md Sections 5-6.

**Security Notes**
- Local-only operations; no new attack surface introduced.

**Best-Practices and References**
- Phaser 3 + TypeScript + Zustand + sql.js stack per docs/architecture.md and package.json; slot flow respects Clean Architecture boundaries.

**Action Items**

**Code Changes Required:**
- None.

**Advisory Notes:**
- Note: When time allows, add focused UI or repository-level tests for unlock and deletion flows to guard against regressions.
