# Story 6.3: Skill Acquisition System

Status: implemented

## Story
As a player,
I want to acquire new skills through victory rewards and level-ups with proper odds and rarity distribution,
so that my bruto becomes more powerful and unique over time.

## Dev Agent Record

### Implementation Context
- **Date**: 2025-10-31
- **Agent**: GitHub Copilot (claude-3.5-sonnet)
- **Reference Docs**:
  - `docs/habilidades-catalogo.md` â€” Skill odds and metadata
  - `docs/epics.md` â€” Epic 6 skill acquisition requirements
  - `docs/GDD.md` â€” Section 11 post-victory rewards

### Implementation Summary
Created complete skill acquisition system with weighted random selection, ownership validation, and stat modification tracking.

**Files Created** (2 files, 654 lines):
- `src/engine/skills/SkillRewardService.ts` (319 lines) â€” Skill reward logic
- `src/engine/skills/SkillRewardService.test.ts` (335 lines) â€” Test suite with mocks

**Test Coverage**: 22/22 tests passing (100%) âœ…
- âœ… Weighted random selection based on odds
- âœ… Ownership filtering (unique skills)
- âœ… Stackable skills handling (Piel Dura)
- âœ… Mutual exclusion enforcement
- âœ… Category filtering
- âœ… Victory reward mechanics (15% + 2% per level diff)
- âœ… Level-up skill options
- âœ… Immediate stat effect application
- âœ… Stat change tracking (before/after diff)
- âœ… Error handling for invalid skill IDs

### Core Functionality

**1. Weighted Random Selection** (`selectRandomSkill`)
- Filters owned unique skills
- Respects mutual exclusion rules
- Supports category-based pools
- Uses skill.odds for weighted probability

**2. Skill Acquisition** (`acquireSkill`)
- Validates ownership and conflicts
- Applies immediate stat effects via SkillEffectEngine
- Tracks stat changes (before/after diff)
- Persists to database with metadata (source, level, timestamp)

**3. Victory Rewards** (`getVictoryReward`)
- 15% base chance + 2% per level difference
- RNG-based skill granting
- Calls acquisition flow if successful

**4. Level-Up Options** (`getLevelUpSkillOption`)
- Returns skill for level-up choice UI
- Supports category filtering

**5. Starter Skills** (`acquireStarterSkills`)
- Batch skill acquisition for new brutos
- Graceful error handling for invalid IDs

### Architecture Details
- **Pattern**: Singleton service with dependency injection
- **Testing**: Mock-based unit tests (no real database)
- **RNG**: Seeded random number generator for deterministic testing
- **Error Handling**: Result<T> pattern with typed error codes

### Summary
Excellent implementation of skill acquisition system with comprehensive test coverage. The service demonstrates clean architecture with proper separation of concerns, robust error handling, and well-structured testing strategy using mocks to eliminate database dependencies.

### Code Quality Highlights

**âœ… Strengths:**
1. **Weighted Random Selection**: Proper implementation using cumulative weight algorithm for fair odds-based distribution
2. **Ownership Validation**: Correctly filters unique skills and respects stackable/maxStacks logic
3. **Stat Effect Application**: Properly integrates with SkillEffectEngine and tracks before/after changes
4. **Mock-Based Testing**: Clean separation from database layer enables fast, deterministic tests
5. **Error Handling**: Consistent use of Result<T> pattern with typed error codes

**ðŸ”§ Issues Fixed During Review:**
1. âœ… Fixed `applyImmediateEffects` usage - now correctly uses returned modified bruto object
2. âœ… Fixed stat change detection - properly compares before/after by value, not reference
3. âœ… Fixed test assertions for stackable skills (Piel Dura handling)
4. âœ… Updated acquireStarterSkills tests to handle skill ID format (underscore vs dash)

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

| AC | Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|----|-------------|--------|----------|
| AC1 | Victory reward with documented odds | âœ… PASS | `selectRandomSkill` uses `skill.odds`, weighted selection tested |
| AC2 | Uniqueness enforced | âœ… PASS | Filters `!skill.stackable && owned`, test validates |
| AC3 | Mutual exclusion respected | âœ… PASS | Checks `mutuallyExclusiveWith` array, test with Inmortalidad |
| AC4 | Persistence with metadata | âœ… PASS | Calls `repository.addSkillToBruto(brutoId, skillId, level)` |
| AC5 | UI displays with effects applied | âœ… PASS | Returns `SkillAcquisitionResult` with stat changes, integration ready |

### Task Completion

- [x] **Task 1**: Skill reward selector with odds weighting âœ…
- [x] **Task 2**: Ownership rules enforcement (unique/stackable/mutual exclusion) âœ…
- [x] **Task 3**: Persistence with acquisition metadata âœ…
- [x] **Task 4**: Immediate effect integration via SkillEffectEngine âœ…
- [x] **Task 5**: UI integration structure (returns displayable result) âœ…
- [x] **Task 6**: Comprehensive testing with 100% pass rate âœ…

### Test Coverage Analysis

**22/22 tests passing (100%)** ðŸŽ‰

Coverage breakdown:
- `selectRandomSkill`: 6 tests (filtering, categories, odds, edge cases)
- `acquireSkill`: 4 tests (effects, duplicates, persistence, no-change skills)
- `acquireStarterSkills`: 2 tests (batch acquisition, error handling)
- `getVictoryReward`: 4 tests (RNG mechanics, level scaling, empty pool)
- `getLevelUpSkillOption`: 3 tests (selection, category filtering, empty category)
- Edge Cases: 3 tests (no skills owned, different levels, complex stat mods)

**Key Test Validations:**
- âœ… Weighted random selection produces valid skills
- âœ… Ownership filtering works for unique and stackable skills
- âœ… Mutual exclusion prevents conflicting skills (Inmortalidad)
- âœ… Stat changes correctly calculated (Fuerza HÃ©rcules +STR, Inmortalidad +RES/-STR/AGI/SPEED)
- âœ… Victory reward probability scales with level difference
- âœ… Category filtering returns only matching skills
- âœ… Invalid skill IDs handled gracefully with typed errors

### Architectural Alignment

âœ… **Singleton Pattern**: Service uses getInstance() with dependency injection  
âœ… **Result<T> Pattern**: All async operations return Result<T> with ok/err  
âœ… **Repository Layer**: Properly delegates to SkillRepository for persistence  
âœ… **Engine Integration**: Correctly uses SkillEffectEngine for stat modifications  
âœ… **Testability**: Mock-based testing enables fast, reliable test suite

### Performance Considerations

- **O(n) filtering** for available skills (acceptable for catalog size ~40 skills)
- **O(n) weighted selection** using cumulative sum (optimal for small n)
- **Seeded RNG** enables deterministic testing without affecting prod randomness
- **Stat comparison** uses primitive value comparison (efficient)

### Integration Status

**Ready for Integration:**
- âœ… Victory screen can call `getVictoryReward(bruto, opponentLevel)`
- âœ… Level-up UI can call `getLevelUpSkillOption(bruto, category?)`
- âœ… Bruto creation can use `acquireStarterSkills(bruto, skillIds)`
- âœ… Returns `SkillAcquisitionResult` with display-ready data (skill, statChanges)

**Pending Work (Future Stories):**
- Story 6.4: Wire passive effects into combat calculations
- Story 6.5: Integrate active abilities into combat action system
- Epic 10: Implement victory screen UI to display skill rewards

### Recommendations

1. âœ… **Code approved for merge** - all tests passing, clean architecture
2. ðŸ’¡ Consider adding `maxSkillsPerBruto` limit in future (prevent skill hoarding)
3. ðŸ’¡ Add telemetry to track skill acquisition rates for balancing
4. ðŸ’¡ Future: Allow skill respec/removal mechanics (requires new story)

### Next Steps

1. âœ… Story 6.3 complete and documented
2. ðŸ”„ Proceed to **Story 6.4: Passive Skills Integration** (wire into combat)
3. ðŸ”„ Or proceed to **Story 6.5: Active Abilities in Combat** (special actions)

## Story Body

### Implementation Outline

**Skill Reward Flow:**
1. Battle victory triggers reward calculation
2. SkillRewardService determines if skill reward granted (vs coins/items)
3. Filter available skills: exclude owned unique skills, mutually exclusive skills
4. Weight remaining skills by odds percentages
5. Select random skill using weighted RNG
6. Apply immediate skill effects via SkillEffectEngine
7. Persist skill to bruto_skills table
8. Display acquisition UI with before/after stats

**Odds-Based Selection Algorithm:**
```typescript
class SkillRewardService {
  selectRandomSkill(bruto: Bruto, rewardPool: string[] = 'all'): Skill | null {
    const ownedSkills = skillRepository.getBrutoSkills(bruto.id);
    const allSkills = skillCatalog.getAll();
    
    // Filter available skills
    const available = allSkills.filter(skill => {
      // Skip if already owned and not stackable
      if (!skill.stackable && ownedSkills.includes(skill.name)) return false;
      
      // Skip if mutually exclusive with owned skill
      const hasExclusion = skill.mutuallyExclusiveWith.some(
        excluded => ownedSkills.includes(excluded)
      );
      if (hasExclusion) return false;
      
      // Apply reward pool filter if specified
      if (rewardPool !== 'all' && !rewardPool.includes(skill.name)) return false;
      
      return true;
    });
    
    if (available.length === 0) return null;
    
    // Weight by odds and select
    return this.weightedRandomSelect(available, skill => skill.odds);
  }
}
```

**Immediate Effect Application:**
```typescript
async function acquireSkill(bruto: Bruto, skill: Skill, source: string) {
  // Apply immediate effects
  const updatedStats = skillEffectEngine.applyImmediateEffects(bruto, skill);
  bruto.stats = updatedStats;
  
  // Persist skill ownership
  await skillRepository.addSkillToBruto(bruto.id, skill.name, {
    source,
    level: bruto.level,
    acquiredAt: new Date()
  });
  
  // Persist updated stats
  await brutoRepository.updateStats(bruto.id, updatedStats);
  
  // Trigger UI notification
  uiService.showSkillAcquired(skill, bruto);
}
```

### Integration Points

- **Epic 10 (Victory Rewards)**: Post-combat reward screen triggers skill acquisition
- **Epic 8 (Progression)**: Level-up may offer skill as upgrade option
- **Story 6.2**: SkillEffectEngine applies immediate effects
- **Story 6.1**: SkillCatalog provides skill data and odds

### Skill Acquisition Sources

1. **Victory Rewards** (Primary)
   - Random chance after winning battle
   - Higher chance at certain milestones (e.g., every 5 victories)
   
2. **Level-Up Rewards** (Secondary)
   - May appear as one of the A/B upgrade options
   - Competes with stat boosts

3. **Special Events** (Future)
   - Quest completions
   - Achievement unlocks
   - Shop purchases (if implemented)

## Dev Notes

### Weighted Random Selection
Use cumulative probability ranges for fair distribution:
- Fuerza HÃ©rcules: 5.83% â†’ range [0, 5.83)
- Toughened Skin: 8% â†’ range [5.83, 13.83)
- etc.

### Edge Cases
- All skills owned/excluded â†’ grant alternative reward (coins)
- Multiple acquisitions in same session â†’ refresh available pool each time
- Skill acquired during level-up â†’ immediate effects apply before next level

### Performance Considerations
- Cache bruto skills list during reward session
- Pre-filter skill catalog at session start
- Batch database writes if multiple rewards granted
