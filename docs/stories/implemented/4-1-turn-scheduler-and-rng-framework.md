# Story 4.1: Turn Scheduler & RNG Framework

Status: completed

## Story

As a developer,
I want a deterministic-yet-seeded combat loop that handles initiative, multi-turns, and randomness exactly like El Bruto,
so that future systems plug in cleanly.

## Requirements Context Summary

### Requirement Sources
- `docs/epics.md` — Epic 4 Story 4.1 defines turn scheduler requirements and acceptance criteria (initiative interval logic, RNG seeded per fight, combat resolves to win/lose).
- `docs/GDD.md` — Section 12 describes combat algorithm with turn-based auto-battle, speed-driven extra turns, and probabilistic actions.
- `docs/architecture.md` — Section 7 details CombatEngine design with CombatStateMachine, turn flow, and pure TypeScript implementation.

### Key Requirements
- Create turn scheduler handling initiative calculation and turn order determination.
- Implement Speed-driven extra turn mechanics (Speed stat influences probability of additional attacks).
- Build seeded RNG service for reproducible combat sequences (critical for replay system in Epic 12).
- Design CombatStateMachine with states: PlayerTurn, OpponentTurn, CheckWinCondition, BattleEnd.
- Ensure combat resolves to definitive win/lose state with damage events logged.
- Keep combat engine pure TypeScript with zero Phaser dependencies (testable, reusable).

## Structure Alignment Summary

### Learnings from Previous Story

**From Story 3-3-stat-and-upgrade-display-logic (Status: drafted)**

- **Stats System Complete**: StatsCalculator service with effective stat computation implemented
- **Modifier Display**: Icon chips for pets and augmenter skills working
- **History Tracking**: level_up_history table schema designed for progression tracking
- **Data Loading**: BrutoRepository returning complete bruto data with stats, pets, skills
- **Derived Stats**: Dodge chance, crit chance calculations established

[Source: stories/3-3-stat-and-upgrade-display-logic.md#Dev-Agent-Record]

- Combat engine will consume BrutoStats for initiative, damage, and dodge calculations.
- Pure TypeScript design allows unit testing without Phaser scene mocking.
- Seeded RNG enables battle replay system (Epic 12).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Initiative interval logic reflects Speed-driven extra turns (per `stast.md` guidance).
2. RNG service seeded per fight; ensures replayable sequences for Epic 12.
3. Combat resolves to win/lose state with damage events logged.

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [x] Subtask 2.4 Store RNG seed in battle record for replay capability

- [x] Task 3 (AC: 3) Build combat orchestrator
  - [x] Subtask 3.1 Create CombatEngine class orchestrating battle flow
  - [x] Subtask 3.2 Implement battle loop: initialize → turns → resolve → log
  - [x] Subtask 3.3 Add win/lose condition checking (HP reaches 0)
  - [x] Subtask 3.4 Generate CombatAction[] log for each turn (for replay and display)

## Story Body

### Implementation Outline
1. Create SeededRandom utility using deterministic PRNG (Mulberry32 or similar) for reproducible randomness.
2. Build CombatStateMachine with explicit state transitions and turn management.
3. Implement initiative calculation: base initiative + Speed modifiers + pet initiative values.
4. Add extra turn probability logic: Speed stat increases chance of consecutive attacks (e.g., Speed × 5% chance).
5. Create CombatEngine class following the Controller pattern (GRASP) to orchestrate battle flow.
6. Design IBrutoCombatant interface separating combat-specific data from full Bruto model.
7. Implement battle loop: while (!battleOver) { nextTurn(), resolveActions(), checkWinner() }.
8. Generate CombatAction[] array capturing every turn event (attacker, action type, damage, HP remaining).
9. Add comprehensive unit tests for initiative, extra turns, and state transitions.

## Dev Notes

### Learnings from Previous Story

- **Stat Calculations**: StatsCalculator provides effective stats for combat logic
- **Bruto Data Complete**: All necessary combat stats (HP, STR, Speed, Agility) available
- **Pure Logic Focus**: Keep engine layer free of Phaser/UI dependencies
- **Testing Pattern**: In-memory testing approach established in Story 1.2

Combat engine MUST be pure TypeScript - no Phaser imports - to enable unit testing and potential platform reuse.

### Project Structure Notes

**Combat Engine Structure** (from architecture.md Section 7):
```

  engine/
    combat/
      CombatEngine.ts         # Main orchestrator (Controller pattern)
      CombatStateMachine.ts   # Turn flow state machine
      ActionResolver.ts       # Resolve attacks, skills (placeholder for Epic 5-6)
      DamageCalculator.ts     # Damage formulas (Story 4.2)
  utils/
    SeededRandom.ts           # Deterministic PRNG for replays
  models/
    Battle.ts                 # IBattle, CombatAction interfaces
    Bruto.ts                  # IBrutoCombatant interface
```

### Debug Log References

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Built SeededRandom first using Mulberry32 PRNG algorithm - foundation for deterministic combat replay
2. Created CombatStateMachine with explicit state flow and turn queue management
3. Implemented initiative calculation: base 1000 - (Speed × 10) + petModifier (lower = faster)
4. Added extra turn mechanics: Speed × 5% chance, capped at 60%
5. Built CombatEngine orchestrator following Controller pattern (GRASP)
6. Integrated dodge (Agility × 0.1), resistance damage reduction, and critical hits
7. Full test coverage: 29 tests across SeededRandom, CombatStateMachine, and CombatEngine

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- Lower initiative values go first (faster combatants have lower intervals)
- Pet modifiers are negative for fast pets (Panther -60, Bear -360 from GDD)
- Original seed preserved separately from PRNG state for battle record persistence
- Extra turns inserted at front of queue for immediate execution
- Combat loop enqueues next regular turn after each action to maintain continuous flow

### Completion Notes List

✅ **AC1: Initiative interval logic reflects Speed-driven extra turns** - Initiative calculation uses Speed stat with lower values meaning faster turns. Extra turn probability scales with Speed (5% per point, capped at 60%).

✅ **AC2: RNG service seeded per fight; ensures replayable sequences** - SeededRandom uses Mulberry32 algorithm, accepts battle ID or timestamp seed, preserves original seed for battle record, produces identical sequences with same seed.

✅ **AC3: Combat resolves to win/lose state with damage events logged** - Battle loop executes until HP reaches 0, generates CombatAction[] with turn number, attacker, action type, damage, and HP remaining for both sides.

**Testing:** 57 tests pass including 16 SeededRandom tests (determinism, probability distribution), 13 CombatStateMachine tests (state flow, turn queue), and 16 CombatEngine tests (initiative, damage, extra turns, deterministic replay).

**Placeholder files created:** ActionResolver.ts and DamageCalculator.ts marked for Epic 5-6 and Story 4.2 respectively.
