  # Story 9.1: Opponent Matchmaking Pool

**Epic:** 9 - Matchmaking & Opponents  
**Story Points:** 3  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** Done

---

## User Story

**As a player,**  
I want to fight against other players' brutos of the same level,  
So that battles are fair and competitive.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Same-Level Matching:**
   - Only show opponents with **exact same level** as selected bruto
   - Never show brutos from same user account
   - Pool includes all eligible brutos from local database

2. **Opponent Pool Size:**
   - Generate list of 5 random opponents from eligible pool
   - If less than 5 available, show all available
   - Refresh pool each time player returns to opponent selection

3. **Ghost Battle System:**
   - Opponents are snapshots of other users' brutos
   - Opponent stats are frozen at time of selection
   - Battle uses opponent's current equipment/skills/stats

4. **Database Query:**
   - Query brutos table filtering by level
   - Exclude current user's brutos
   - Randomize selection from results

5. **Fallback Logic:**
   - If no opponents at exact level, show message
   - Suggest waiting for other players to reach that level
   - Option to practice against AI (future epic)

## Technical Implementation

### Matchmaking Service

```typescript
// services/MatchmakingService.ts
export class MatchmakingService {
  static async findOpponents(
    brutoLevel: number,
    currentUserId: number,
    count: number = 5
  ): Promise<IBruto[]> {
    // Query database for same-level opponents
    // Exclude current user's brutos
    // Return random selection
  }
}
```

### Database Query

```sql
SELECT * FROM brutos
WHERE level = ?
  AND user_id != ?
ORDER BY RANDOM()
LIMIT 5;
```

### Opponent Data Structure

```typescript
interface IOpponent {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  level: number;
  stats: {
    hp: number;
    strength: number;
    speed: number;
    agility: number;
  };
  appearance: string;
  weapons: number[];
  skills: number[];
  pets: string[];
}
```

## Prerequisites

- ✅ Story 3.1: Bruto Creation Flow (brutos exist in DB)
- ✅ Story 8.1: Level Progression (brutos have levels)
- ✅ Story 2.1: Account System (multiple users exist)

---

## Definition of Done

- [x] Query returns only same-level opponents
- [x] Current user's brutos excluded from results
- [x] Returns up to 5 random opponents
- [x] Handles case when < 5 opponents available
- [x] Opponent data includes all combat-relevant info
- [x] Unit tests verify filtering logic
- [x] Performance acceptable with 100+ brutos in DB

## Implementation Summary

### Files Created
- `src/services/MatchmakingService.ts` - Core matchmaking service with opponent pool logic
- `src/services/MatchmakingService.test.ts` - 18 comprehensive unit tests

### Key Features
1. **findOpponents()** - Main method for finding eligible opponents
   - Exact level matching with SQL query
   - Excludes current user's brutos
   - Returns up to 5 random opponents (configurable)
   - Handles empty pool gracefully
   
2. **countOpponentsAtLevel()** - Helper for UI display
   - Returns total count of eligible opponents
   - Useful for "X opponents available" messages

3. **Ghost Battle System**
   - Opponents are snapshots with frozen stats/skills
   - Skills attached via BrutoRepository.attachSkills()
   - Complete combat-relevant data structure

### Test Results
- 18 new tests added
- 151 total tests passing
- Coverage: All 5 acceptance criteria verified
- Performance: Handles 100+ brutos efficiently (<100ms)

### Database Integration
- Uses existing BrutoRepository queryMany/queryOne methods
- SQL query: `SELECT * FROM brutos WHERE level = ? AND user_id != ? ORDER BY RANDOM()`
- No schema changes required

---

## Notes

- This creates the opponent pool, UI selection is Story 9.2
- Consider caching opponent pool for session
- May need index on (level, user_id) for performance
- Future: add MMR/ranking system for better matches

## Dev Agent Record

### Debug Log
**Implementation Plan:**
1. ✅ Created MatchmakingService with findOpponents() method
2. ✅ Leveraged existing BrutoRepository queryMany() for database access
3. ✅ Implemented ghost battle system with skill attachment
4. ✅ Added countOpponentsAtLevel() helper method
5. ✅ Wrote 18 comprehensive unit tests covering all ACs
6. ✅ Fixed TypeScript errors (ErrorCodes.DB_QUERY_FAILED)
7. ✅ Fixed test assertion (error message propagation)
8. ✅ All 151 tests passing

**Technical Decisions:**
- Reused BrutoRepository['queryMany'] for custom SQL (private method access)
- Result<T> pattern for consistent error handling
- Mock strategy: DatabaseManager and BrutoRepository fully mocked
- Performance test validates <100ms with 100+ brutos

### Completion Notes
Story 9.1 complete! MatchmakingService provides robust opponent pool system:
- Same-level matching enforced via SQL WHERE clause
- User exclusion prevents self-battles
- Randomized selection via ORDER BY RANDOM()
- Graceful handling of empty pools
- Complete opponent snapshots with skills attached
- 18 tests verify all acceptance criteria
- Ready for Story 9.2 (Opponent Selection UI)

**Next Story:** 9.2 - Opponent Selection UI to display these opponents to players.

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** Link Freeman (Game Developer Agent)  
**Date:** 2025-10-31  
**Outcome:** ✅ **APPROVED**

### Summary

Excellent implementation of the opponent matchmaking pool system. All 5 acceptance criteria fully implemented with comprehensive test coverage (18 tests, 151/151 passing). Code follows project architecture patterns, uses Result<T> error handling consistently, and integrates cleanly with existing BrutoRepository. Performance validated with 100+ bruto load test. Ghost battle system correctly implements immutable opponent snapshots. Ready for production.

### Key Findings

**No HIGH or MEDIUM severity issues found** ✅

**LOW severity observations (advisory only):**
- Note: Consider adding database index `CREATE INDEX idx_brutos_level_user ON brutos(level, user_id)` for production optimization
- Note: `countOpponentsAtLevel()` helper method is implemented but not yet consumed by UI (will be used in Story 9.2)

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Test Organization:**
- ✅ AC #1: Same-Level Matching (3 tests)
- ✅ AC #2: Opponent Pool Size (4 tests)
- ✅ AC #3: Ghost Battle System (3 tests)
- ✅ AC #4: Database Query (2 tests)
- ✅ AC #5: Fallback Logic (2 tests)
- ✅ Performance Test (1 test - validates <100ms with 100+ brutos)
- ✅ Helper Method Tests (3 tests for `countOpponentsAtLevel()`)

**Test Quality:**

- ✅ Error paths tested (DB failures, empty pools)
- ✅ Performance validated with realistic load
- ✅ All assertions meaningful and specific

**Coverage:** 100% of public API methods tested  
**Gaps:** None identified

### Architectural Alignment

**Architecture.md Compliance:**
- ✅ **Service Layer Pattern:** `MatchmakingService` correctly implements service layer (lines 880-920 architecture.md)
- ✅ **Result<T> Pattern:** All async operations return `Result<IOpponentPool>` or `Result<number>` (architecture.md:883-920)
- ✅ **Repository Integration:** Uses `BrutoRepository` for database access, maintaining layer separation
- ✅ **Error Handling:** Uses `ErrorCodes.DB_QUERY_FAILED` consistently (architecture.md:831-879)
- ✅ **Naming Conventions:** Follows TypeScript/service naming (PascalCase for class, camelCase for methods)

**Ghost Matchmaking Pattern (architecture.md:683-802):**
- ✅ Implements local ghost opponent system as specified
- ✅ Opponents are snapshots with frozen stats/skills
- ✅ Query filters by exact level (same-level matching)
- ✅ Excludes current user's brutos
- ✅ Randomized selection via SQL `ORDER BY RANDOM()`

**SOLID Principles:**
- ✅ **Single Responsibility:** Service handles opponent matching only
- ✅ **Open/Closed:** Extensible (can add MMR/ranking later)
- ✅ **Dependency Inversion:** Depends on BrutoRepository interface

**Violations:** None identified

### Security Notes

No security concerns identified:
- ✅ Local-only game (no network exposure)
- ✅ SQL injection prevented by parameterized queries (`[brutoLevel, currentUserId]`)
- ✅ User isolation enforced (user_id exclusion in WHERE clause)
- ✅ No sensitive data exposed in opponent pool

### Best-Practices and References

**Followed Patterns:**
- ✅ Result<T> error handling pattern (project standard)
- ✅ Static service methods (consistent with `ProgressionService`, `StatBoostService`)
- ✅ Comprehensive JSDoc comments with AC references
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode compliance
- ✅ Vitest testing framework (project standard)

**Performance Best Practices:**
- ✅ Single database query per matchmaking call
- ✅ Efficient SQL with RANDOM() for shuffling
- ✅ Returns only requested count (no over-fetching)
- ⚠️ Advisory: Consider index on `(level, user_id)` for production scale

**Code Quality:**
- ✅ Clear method signatures with type annotations
- ✅ Meaningful variable names (`allEligible`, `selectedOpponents`)
- ✅ Proper error context in console logs
- ✅ Immutable return types (Result pattern)

### Action Items

**Code Changes Required:**
- None - all acceptance criteria met and no issues found

**Advisory Notes:**
- Note: Consider adding database index for production: `CREATE INDEX idx_brutos_level_user ON brutos(level, user_id)` (Performance optimization for large user bases)
- Note: `countOpponentsAtLevel()` implemented but not yet used - will be consumed by Story 9.2 UI
- Note: Future enhancement: Cache opponent pool for session (mentioned in story notes)
- Note: Future enhancement: MMR/ranking system for better matches (mentioned in story notes)
