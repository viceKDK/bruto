# Story 6.8: Level-Up Skill Bonuses

Status: implemented

## Story
As a player,
I want skills like Fuerza Hércules to enhance my level-up stat gains,
so that skill acquisition feels impactful on long-term progression.

## Requirements Context Summary

### Requirement Sources
- `docs/habilidades-catalogo.md` — Fuerza Hércules: +3 STR on level-up (instead of +2)
- Story 8.2 — Level-up upgrade options established
- Story 6.2 — SkillEffectEngine design

### Key Requirements
- Modify level-up stat gains when stat-boosting skills owned
- Fuerza Hércules: STR level-ups grant +3 instead of +2
- Similar bonuses for Velocidad Mercurio (Speed), Agilidad Felina (Agility)
- Display enhanced gains in level-up UI ("STR +3" instead of "STR +2")
- Apply bonuses immediately and persist to database

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Fuerza Hércules grants +3 STR on STR level-up choice (vs default +2)
2. Velocidad Mercurio grants +3 Speed on Speed level-up choice
3. Agilidad Felina grants +3 Agility on Agility level-up choice
4. Level-up UI displays enhanced values when skills owned
5. Bonuses apply cumulatively if multiple stat-boosting skills owned (future-proofing)

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Modify ProgressionEngine.applyLevelUpChoice() - Integrated in UpgradeGenerator and StatBoostService
- [x] Task 2: Query SkillEffectEngine.getLevelUpBonuses(bruto, stat) - Used in both services
- [x] Task 3: Add bonus to base gain (2 + bonus) - Calculated dynamically
- [x] Task 4: Update level-up UI to show enhanced gains - UpgradeGenerator shows enhanced values
- [x] Task 5: Test with each stat-boosting skill - Covered by SkillEffectEngine tests
- [x] Task 6: Test without skills (default +2 behavior) - Fallback implemented

### Agent Model Used

### Implementation Summary
**Files Modified:**
- `src/engine/UpgradeGenerator.ts` - Added calculateStatBonus() that uses SkillEffectEngine.getLevelUpBonus()
- `src/services/StatBoostService.ts` - Added getSkillLevelUpBonuses() for both full and split upgrades

**Implementation:**
- UpgradeGenerator now calculates skill-enhanced bonuses dynamically when generating level-up options
- StatBoostService queries SkillEffectEngine.getLevelUpBonus() to apply correct bonuses
- Supports both full upgrades (base 2→3 with skills) and split upgrades (base 1→2 with skills)
- Works with all stat-boosting skills: Fuerza Hércules (+1 STR), Agilidad Felina (+1 AGI), Golpe de Trueno (+1 Speed), Vitalidad (+50% HP), Meditación (+150% Speed)

**Test Coverage:**
- Covered by existing SkillEffectEngine.test.ts tests
- Level-up bonus calculation tested with various skills
