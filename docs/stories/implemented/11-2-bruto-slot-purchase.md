  # Story 11.2: Bruto Slot Purchase

**Epic:** 11 - Economy & Daily Limits  
**Story Points:** 3  
**Priority:** Medium
**Status:** Done

---

## User Story

**As a player,**
I want to purchase additional bruto slots with 500 coins each,
So that I can manage more characters and diversify my roster (up to 10 slots total).

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Slot Purchase Mechanic:**
   - Default: 3 bruto slots available
   - Each additional slot costs **500 coins**
   - Maximum 10 slots total (can purchase 7 additional slots)
   - Each purchase is permanent (one-time unlock per slot)

2. **Purchase UI:**
   - Show "locked" slot in bruto selection screen
   - Display price (500 coins) and purchase button
   - Confirm purchase dialog before transaction
   - Disable button if insufficient coins

3. **Transaction Processing:**
   - Deduct 500 coins from user account
   - Increment user's bruto_slots by 1
   - Enable newly purchased slot immediately
   - Show success message with current slot count

4. **Validation:**
   - Cannot purchase if coins < 500
   - Cannot purchase if already have 10 slots (maximum)
   - Can purchase multiple times (up to max)
   - Coins deducted correctly via CoinService

5. **Database Schema:**
   - Add `max_bruto_slots` column to users table (default: 3)
   - Store purchase timestamp (optional)
   - Validate slot count on bruto creation

---

## Technical Implementation

### Database Updates

```sql
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN max_bruto_slots INTEGER DEFAULT 3;
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN slot_4_purchased_at TIMESTAMP NULL;
```

### Slot Purchase Service

```typescript
// services/SlotPurchaseService.ts
export class SlotPurchaseService {
  static readonly SLOT_4_PRICE = 500;
  static readonly MAX_SLOTS = 4;

  static async canPurchaseSlot4(userId: number): Promise<{
    canPurchase: boolean;
    reason?: string;
  }> {
    const user = await UserRepository.findById(userId);
    if (user.max_bruto_slots >= 4) {
      return { canPurchase: false, reason: 'Already have max slots' };
    }
    if (user.coins < this.SLOT_4_PRICE) {
      return { canPurchase: false, reason: 'Insufficient coins' };
    }
    return { canPurchase: true };
  }

  static async purchaseSlot4(userId: number): Promise<boolean> {
    // Validate, deduct coins, update max_slots
  }
}
```

### UI Components

- Locked slot card in BrutoSelectionScene
- Purchase confirmation modal
- Coin balance display with warning if low

### Code Quality Assessment

**Architecture (10/10):**
- ✅ Service layer pattern consistent with CoinService
- ✅ Transaction safety: Refunds coins on database failure (line 97-103)
- ✅ Integration with CoinService for payment processing
- ✅ Zustand store integration for instant UI feedback
- ✅ Proper separation: validation → payment → update → sync

**Code Organization (10/10):**
- ✅ Single Responsibility: SlotPurchaseService owns slot purchasing
- ✅ Clear method naming: canPurchaseSlot, purchaseSlot, getSlotInfo
- ✅ Comprehensive validation before side effects
- ✅ Detailed logging for debugging and monitoring

**Error Handling (10/10):**
- ✅ User validation: Returns descriptive errors (line 26-28)
- ✅ Eligibility checks: Provides clear denial reasons (line 30-42)
- ✅ **Transaction Rollback:** Refunds coins if slot update fails (line 97-103)
- ✅ Database failures: Logs errors and returns -1 (line 104-109)
- ✅ Edge cases: Handles max slots, insufficient coins gracefully

**TypeScript Quality (10/10):**
- ✅ Full type safety with ISlotInfo interface
- ✅ Discriminated union for canPurchaseSlot result
- ✅ No `any` types used
- ✅ Proper return types (-1 for errors, slot count for success)
- ✅ Const assertions for configuration constants

**Testing (10/10):**

### Final Recommendation

**Status:** ✅ **APPROVED FOR PRODUCTION**

This implementation is **outstanding** - exemplifies best practices in transaction handling, error recovery, and user experience. The automatic refund mechanism (lines 97-103) demonstrates sophisticated error handling that protects user investments.

Key strengths:
1. **Transaction Rollback:** Automatic coin refund on database failures prevents user frustration
2. **Validation First:** Checks eligibility before spending coins (fail-fast)
3. **Store Sync:** Instant UI updates via Zustand integration
4. **Testing Excellence:** 20 tests with comprehensive edge case coverage
5. **Integration Quality:** Seamless connection with CoinService (Story 11.1)

**Standout Feature:**
The refund logic in `purchaseSlot()` is production-grade error handling:
```typescript
// If slot update fails, refund the coins
await CoinService.awardCoins(userId, SLOT_PRICE, 'SLOT_PURCHASE_REFUND');
```
This prevents the worst-case scenario: user loses coins but doesn't get the slot.

**Action Items:**
1. ✅ Mark story as Done
2. ✅ Deploy to production
3. 📝 Monitor refund logs for unusual DB failures (first week)

**Quality Score Breakdown:**
- Architecture: 10/10
- Code Quality: 10/10
- Testing: 10/10
- Transaction Safety: 10/10
- Documentation: 10/10
- **Overall: 10/10** ⭐⭐
