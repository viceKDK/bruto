## 💡 Key Features Delivered

### Story 6.5: Active Abilities
1. **Fuerza Bruta (Double Damage)**
   - STR-scaling uses: `Math.floor(STR / 30) + 1`
   - Examples: 29 STR = 1 use, 60 STR = 3 uses
   - Applied automatically during attacks
   - Uses decremented after each activation

2. **Poción Trágica (Heal)**
   - One-time use per battle
   - Random healing: 25-50% of max HP
   - Capped at max HP (no overheal)

3. **Battle Lifecycle**
   - Abilities initialized at battle start
   - State persists through combat
   - Full reset when new battle begins

### Story 6.6: Stacking & Caps
1. **Armor Cap Enforcement**
   - Maximum 75% armor from skills
   - Warning logged when exceeded
   - Example: Toughened Skin (10%) + Armor (25%) + Esqueleto (15%) = 50% ✓

2. **Skill Validation**
   - Unique skills cannot be acquired twice
   - Stackable skills respect `maxStacks` limit
   - Mutual exclusions enforced (catalog-driven)

3. **Debug Tools**
   - `calculateTotalArmor()` - Calculate current armor
   - `getStackingInfo()` - Check stacking status
   - `getStackingDebugInfo()` - Full debug report

## 📊 Architecture Impact

### New Classes
- `ActiveAbilityManager` - Combat ability state management
- `ActiveAbilityEffects` - Ability effect application
- `SkillStackingValidator` - Skill acquisition validation

### Integration Points
- **CombatEngine** - Active ability checking during attacks
- **SkillEffectEngine** - Armor cap enforcement in modifiers
- **SkillCatalog** - New "Armor" skill added

### Design Patterns Used
- **Singleton Pattern** - All managers/services
- **Factory Pattern** - Ability creation based on owned skills
- **Strategy Pattern** - Effect application (damage vs heal)
- **Validator Pattern** - Skill acquisition rules

## 🎮 Gameplay Examples

### Example 1: Fuerza Bruta Usage
```typescript
Bruto with STR 45 → 2 uses of Fuerza Bruta
  Turn 1: Attack for 50 damage → AUTO-APPLIES Fuerza Bruta → 100 damage (1 use left)
  Turn 3: Attack for 50 damage → AUTO-APPLIES Fuerza Bruta → 100 damage (0 uses left)
  Turn 5: Attack for 50 damage → Normal attack → 50 damage
Next Battle: Fuerza Bruta resets to 2 uses ✅
```

### Example 2: Armor Stacking
```typescript
Bruto acquires skills:
  1. Toughened Skin → 10% armor ✅
  2. Armor → 25% armor (total: 35%) ✅
  3. Esqueleto de Plomo → 15% armor (total: 50%) ✅
  4. Try to acquire another Armor → 75% would be at cap ✅
  5. Try to acquire 4th armor skill → Would exceed 75% cap → Capped at 75% with warning ⚠️
```

### Example 3: Poción Trágica
```typescript
Combat starts: Bruto at 50/100 HP
  Turn 4: Poción Trágica activated → Heals 37 HP (random 25-50%) → Now at 87/100 HP
  Turn 8: Try to use Poción Trágica → Not available (already used) ❌
Next Battle: Poción Trágica available again ✅
```
