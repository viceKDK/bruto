# Story 3.3: Stat & Upgrade Display Logic

Status: review

## Story

As a player,
I want to see my bruto's current stats, pets, and passive modifiers reflecting every upgrade,
so that I can plan future builds.

## Requirements Context Summary

### Requirement Sources
- `docs/epics.md` — Epic 3 Story 3.3 defines stat display requirements and acceptance criteria (stat panel pulls real values, icon chips for pets/modifiers, level-up history view).
- `docs/GDD.md` — Section 10 details the stats system (HP, STR, Speed, Agility, Resistance) and Section 11 covers augmenter skills that modify stat gains.
- `docs/architecture.md` — Section 6 defines BrutoStats interface with effective stat calculations.

### Key Requirements
- Display current bruto stats (HP, max HP, STR, Speed, Agility, Resistance) pulling real values from database.
- Show effective stats that include modifiers from weapons, skills, and pets.
- Create icon chips displaying acquired pets with inline descriptions.
- Add passive modifier display (augmenter skills like Herculean Strength, Feline Agility).
- Implement level-up history view listing A/B choices made at each level.
- Calculate and display derived stats (dodge chance from Agility, attack speed from Speed).

## Structure Alignment Summary

### Learnings from Previous Story

**From Story 3-2-casillero-ui-recreation (Status: drafted)**

## Dev Notes

### Learnings from Previous Story

- **StatPanel Component**: Base implementation ready in Casillero scene
- **Data Loading**: BrutoRepository provides bruto data including stats
- **Pet System Schema**: bruto_pets table designed in Story 1.2
- **Tooltip Pattern**: Tooltip component for hover details established

Effective stats will initially show base values; weapon/skill modifiers will be added in Epic 5 and 6.

### Agent Model Used

{{agent_model_name_version}}

### Debug Log References

- 2025-10-30T22:10:00Z Implementation Plan:
  - Wire database services to hydrate bruto stats, pets, and level-up history, then expose computed values through a dedicated `StatsCalculator`.
  - Extend Casillero UI with stat, modifier, and history panels using reusable chips/tooltips so designers can validate presentation quickly.
  - Back changes with targeted unit tests and finish by updating story metadata (tasks, notes, file list) once validations pass.
- 2025-10-30T22:18:12Z Task 1 Planning:
  - Add `StatsCalculator` with extender hooks for weapons/skills/pets while returning base stats as effective defaults until later epics boost them.
  - Refresh Casillero stat panel to pull real `IBruto` values from repository/store, formatting both raw and derived metrics (HP, STR, Speed, Agility, Resistance, dodge%).
  - Build presentational rows with tooltip-ready breakdowns so future modifier data can plug in without revisiting layout logic.
- 2025-10-30T22:25:47Z Task 1 Complete:
  - Added `StatsCalculator` with flat/multiplier pipelines and derivative outputs, covered by vitest unit suite.
  - Hydrated Casillero stats from `BrutoRepository` and rendered base/effective values plus delta coloring via new `StatsPanel`.
  - Surfaced derived dodge and extra-turn odds with copy aligned to GDD curve assumptions, ready for richer modifier feeds in later epics.
- 2025-10-30T22:32:05Z Task 2 Planning:
  - Build lightweight `IconChip`/`StatsPanel` extensions to render augmenters and pets without recomputing layout math every update.
  - Wire new `BrutoPetRepository` to hydrate mascot data and normalize resistance costs straight from migrations.
  - Extract helper mappers so UI and tests stay decoupled from Phaser runtime.
- 2025-10-30T22:40:58Z Task 2 Complete:
  - Chips now show augmenters and pets with tooltips, auto-color delta states, and wrap gracefully inside the expanded stats panel.
  - Pet data loads via repository lookup; augmenter summaries derive from skill IDs, de-duplicated and future-proof for new entries.
  - Added focused vitest coverage for mapper helpers; Casillero stat workflow updates along with sprint status and story metadata.
- 2025-10-30T22:48:32Z Task 3 Planning:
  - Stand up `LevelUpHistoryRepository` to hydrate level-up choices and funnel them through a new panel component.
  - Split the Casillero skill panel to host both skill grid and a collapsible history list without breaking existing layout math.
  - Budget for toggle interactions and empty-state copy that guides designers when no data exists yet.
- 2025-10-30T22:56:04Z Task 3 Complete:
  - Added expandable history rows with time stamps, highlighting the chosen option and collapsing per entry on demand.
  - Level-up history now streams directly from storage; empty rosters show tailored guidance instead of blank UI.
  - Tests cover data mapping helpers so display logic stays deterministic outside Phaser runtime.

### Completion Notes List

✅ **AC1: Stat panel pulls real values from DB** - StatsCalculator service computes effective stats with flat/multiplier modifiers. StatPanel displays base, effective, and delta values with color coding. Derived stats (dodge %, extra turn %) calculated per GDD formulas. All stats pull from brutos table via BrutoRepository.

✅ **AC2: Icon chips display acquired pets/multipliers** - IconChip component renders augmenter skills and pets with tooltips. BrutoPetRepository loads pet data with resistance costs. Augmenter detection via skill IDs (Herculean Strength, Feline Agility, etc.). Color-coded chips with inline descriptions.

✅ **AC3: Level-up history view lists choices taken** - LevelUpHistoryRepository loads level-up choices from level_up_history table. LevelUpHistoryPanel displays expandable/collapsible entries showing level, options A/B, and chosen option with timestamps. Empty state guidance for new brutos.

**Implementation Complete:**
- Stats panel expanded to include augmenter and pet chip rows with hover tooltips plus color-coded deltas for quick scanning
- Bruto pets load through BrutoPetRepository and new helper mappers, exposing resistance costs directly in UI
- Refactored scene helpers into testable module and covered mapper logic with vitest for deterministic formatting
- Introduced level-up history panel with collapsible entries, fed by new repository wiring and synced with Casillero layout

**Test Coverage:**
- StatsCalculator.test.ts: 3 tests covering base stats, modifiers, and derived stat calculations
- BrutoDetailsScene.helpers.test.ts: 6 tests covering timestamp formatting and helper functions
- All 93 project tests passing ✅

# Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** vice
**Date:** 2025-10-30
**Review Model:** claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929

## Outcome: ✅ APPROVE

**Justification:** All 3 acceptance criteria fully implemented with evidence. All 12 completed tasks verified (1 minor documentation note, no implementation issue). 93 tests passing including new stat calculator tests. Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns. GDD formulas correctly implemented. Code quality excellent with TypeScript best practices. No security issues. Performance optimized with object pooling.

## Summary

Performed systematic validation of Story 3.3 by reading ALL implementation files, validating EVERY acceptance criterion with evidence, and verifying EVERY task marked complete was actually implemented. Implementation is excellent with clean separation between engine logic (StatsCalculator), UI components (StatsPanel, IconChip, LevelUpHistoryPanel), and data access (Repositories). All formulas match GDD specifications precisely.

## Key Findings (by severity)

### ⚠️ LOW - Documentation Inconsistency (Not a blocker)

**Finding:** Subtask 3.1 description says "Create level_up_history table to track choices" but the table already existed from Story 1.2 (Initial Database Layer).

**Evidence:**
- `001_initial_schema.sql:114-125` - Table created in Story 1.2
- Story Dev Notes mention creating `003_level_up_history.sql` migration, but it wasn't needed

**Assessment:** This is a documentation inconsistency, NOT an implementation issue. The dev agent correctly recognized the table existed and used it properly. The LevelUpHistoryRepository works perfectly with the existing schema.

**Resolution:** Update Dev Notes to clarify: "Used existing level_up_history table from Story 1.2 schema (no new migration needed)".

## Acceptance Criteria Coverage

**Summary:** 3 of 3 acceptance criteria fully implemented ✅

| AC# | Description | Status | Evidence (file:line) |

## Test Coverage and Gaps

### Tests Passing ✅
- `StatsCalculator.test.ts`: 3 tests (base stats, modifiers, derived stats)
- `BrutoDetailsScene.helpers.test.ts`: 6 tests (timestamp formatting, mappers)
- **All 93 project tests passing** ✅

### Test Quality ✅
- Good coverage of stat calculation formulas
- Helper function mappers tested (augmenters, pets)
- Edge cases handled (empty augmenters, no pets)
- Deterministic behavior verified

### Test Gaps (Low priority, not blockers)
- No integration test for full stat panel rendering with real data
- IconChip component not unit tested (Phaser UI - typically manual/E2E tested)
- LevelUpHistoryPanel not unit tested (Phaser UI - typically manual/E2E tested)

**Note:** Phaser UI components are typically tested via manual/E2E rather than unit tests. Current coverage is appropriate for project level.

## Architectural Alignment

### Clean Architecture Compliance ✅
- **Information Expert pattern**: StatsCalculator owns all stat computation logic
- **Repository pattern**: BrutoPetRepository, LevelUpHistoryRepository for data access
- **Separation of Concerns**: Engine (StatsCalculator) → UI (StatsPanel) → Data (Repositories)
- **Phaser Best Practices**: Container-based UI with proper lifecycle management (destroy methods)

### GDD Formula Compliance ✅
- **Dodge formula**: Agility × 0.1 (capped 95%) - matches architecture.md Section 10 ✅
  - Evidence: StatsCalculator.ts:110 `const rawDodgeChance = Math.min(0.95, bruto.agility * 0.1);`
- **Extra turn formula**: Speed × 0.05 (capped 60%) - matches GDD Section 12 ✅
  - Evidence: StatsCalculator.ts:113 `const rawExtraTurnChance = Math.min(0.6, bruto.speed * 0.05);`
- **Pet resistance costs**: Dog -2, Panther -6, Bear -8 - matches GDD Section 10 ✅
  - Evidence: BrutoPetRepository.ts:62-76 (resolveResistanceCost method)

### TypeScript Best Practices ✅
- Proper use of union types (`'A' | 'B'` for chosenOption)
- Interface segregation (separate interfaces for data/config/display)
- Readonly properties where appropriate
- No `any` types - full type safety maintained

## Security Notes

✅ **No security issues found**
- No user input validation needed (read-only display)
- Repository uses parameterized queries (SQL injection protection)
- No sensitive data exposure
- No authentication/authorization concerns (display only)

## Best-Practices and References

### Performance Strengths ✅
1. **Object Pooling**: IconChip components pooled and reused (StatsPanel.ts:415-432) for efficiency
2. **Lazy Loading**: Chips only created when needed, not pre-allocated
3. **Efficient Rendering**: Only updates changed values, no full re-render on update
4. **Proper Cleanup**: All destroy() methods implemented to prevent memory leaks

### Code Quality Strengths ✅
1. **Clean TypeScript**: Proper typing throughout, interfaces well-defined
2. **Reusable Components**: IconChip is generic and reusable elsewhere
3. **Single Responsibility**: Each class has one clear purpose
4. **Dependency Injection**: Repositories injected via constructor

### Minor Optimization Opportunities (Optional, not blockers)
1. **Caching**: Consider caching augmenter skill map lookups (helpers.ts:125-148)
   - **Impact:** Low (only runs on bruto selection change)
   - **Action:** Optional optimization for later
2. **Tooltip Performance**: Tooltip re-positions on every pointermove event (StatsPanel.ts:474-477)
   - **Impact:** Negligible (Phaser handles this efficiently)
   - **Action:** Monitor if performance issues arise

### References
- **Phaser 3 Best Practices**: Container composition, interactive zones, lifecycle management
- **TypeScript Patterns**: Union types, interface segregation, readonly modifiers
- **Clean Code**: SOLID principles, GRASP patterns (Information Expert, Controller)

## Action Items

### Code Changes Required:
*None - all acceptance criteria met and implementation verified*

### Advisory Notes:
- **Note:** Update Dev Notes to clarify that level_up_history table was reused from Story 1.2, not created new (prevents future confusion)
- **Note:** Consider adding integration test for full stats panel rendering in future test expansion (Epic 12+)
